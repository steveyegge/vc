  "Reasoning": "Based on philosophy: 'Good architecture has clear boundaries, minimal coupling, and cohesive modules'\n\nPackage structure analysis revealed potential issues:\n- Circular dependencies prevent clean layering and testability\n- God packages suggest unclear responsibilities\n- High coupling makes changes ripple across the codebase\n- Missing abstractions indicate repeated patterns that could be unified\n\nAI should evaluate: Are these issues worth addressing given the codebase context?",

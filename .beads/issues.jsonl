TRIGGER MECHANISM (activity-based, not time-based):\n\n   When to check: After each issue completion or during executor idle time\n\n   What to track:\n   - Git diff stats since last review checkpoint\n   - Commit SHA of last review\n   - Heavy churn areas (per-directory)\n\n   Storage:\n   type ReviewCheckpoint struct {\n       CommitSHA   string    // Last reviewed commit\n       Timestamp   time.Time\n       ReviewScope string    // \"quick\" | \"thorough\" | \"targeted:path/to/dir\"\n   }\n\n2. AI DECISION LAYER (ZFC-compliant):\n\n   Prompt structure:\n   Context:\n   - Since last review (commit \u003cSHA\u003e, \u003cN\u003e days ago):\n     - \u003cX\u003e lines added, \u003cY\u003e deleted\n     - \u003cN\u003e files changed\n     - Heavy churn areas: \u003clist\u003e\n   - Codebase: ~\u003cN\u003e total lines\n   - Last review findings: \u003csummary\u003e\n\n   Philosophy:\n   Review when enough work has accumulated that subtle issues could emerge.\n   Consider: churn magnitude, critical areas touched, time elapsed, previous findings.\n\n   Decide:\n   1. Should we trigger a code review now? (yes/no)\n   2. If yes, what scope? (quick/thorough/targeted)\n   3. Which areas? (broad or specific packages/directories)\n\n   Return JSON:\n   {\n     \"should_review\": true/false,\n     \"reasoning\": \"...\",\n     \"scope\": \"quick\" | \"thorough\" | \"targeted\",\n     \"target_areas\": [\"internal/executor\"] or null,\n     \"estimated_files\": 5-15,\n     \"estimated_cost\": \"$1-5\"\n   }\n\n3. CASCADING REVIEW DEPTHS:\n\n   Scope levels (AI chooses):\n   - quick: 3-5 files, surface-level scan, ~$1, focus on obvious issues\n   - thorough: 10-15 files, deep analysis, ~$5, catch subtle problems\n   - targeted: Focus on specific high-churn directories\n   - broad: Random sampling across entire codebase\n\n   AI determines depth based on:\n   - Magnitude of changes\n   - Criticality of areas touched\n   - Time since last review\n   - Previous findings\n\n4. FILE REVIEW ISSUES (don't execute inline):\n\n   When AI says \"yes, review needed\":\n\n   a. Create review issue with target areas, scope, file list\n   b. Tag with: code-review-sweep\n   c. Issue gets claimed/executed like any other task\n   d. When complete: Update checkpoint (commit SHA, timestamp, scope)\n\n5. PER-FILE REVIEW PROMPT:\n\n   Philosophy: '...'\n   Context:\n   - File purpose (inferred from package/name)\n   - Recent changes (git diff summary)\n   - Related files (from imports/references)\n\n   Task: Review for issues missed during focused task work.\n\n   Look for:\n   - Inefficiencies (algorithmic, resource usage)\n   - Subtle bugs (race conditions, off-by-one, copy-paste)\n   - Poor patterns (coupling, complexity, duplication)\n   - Missing best practices (error handling, docs, tests)\n   - Unnamed anti-patterns (things that 'feel wrong')\n\n   File: [full file content]\n\n   Return JSON (0-3 issues per file):\n   {\n     'issues': [\n       {\n         'type': 'efficiency' | 'bug' | 'pattern' | 'best_practice' | 'other',\n         'severity': 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',\n         'location': 'file.go:45-67',\n         'title': 'Short description',\n         'description': 'Detailed explanation',\n         'suggestion': 'How to fix',\n         'priority': 'P0' | 'P1' | 'P2' | 'P3'\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n\n6. FILE DISCOVERED ISSUES:\n\n   - One issue per problem found\n   - Include AI reasoning and suggestion\n   - Tag with 'code-review-sweep'\n   - Priority as suggested by AI\n   - Link to parent review issue (discovered-from)\n\n7. EXCLUSIONS:\n\n   - Generated files: *.pb.go, *.gen.go\n   - Vendor code: vendor/*, third_party/*\n   - Very large files: \u003e1000 lines\n   - Binary/non-code files\n\n8. GIT DIFF METRICS (simple, practical):\n\n   git diff --shortstat $LAST_CHECKPOINT_SHA..HEAD\n   git diff --stat $LAST_CHECKPOINT_SHA..HEAD | grep \"internal/\"\n\n   Fast, accurate, good enough for AI decision-making.\n\n9. WHEN TO CHECK:\n\n   Trigger points:\n   - After each issue completion (cheap git diff check)\n   - During executor idle time\n   - Explicit command: vc review check\n\n   Flow:\n   1. Issue completed → git diff --shortstat\n   2. Pass metrics to AI: \"Should we review?\"\n   3. If yes → File review issue(s)\n   4. If no → Continue working\n\nREMOVED FROM ORIGINAL DESIGN:\n- Time-based scheduling (daily cron)\n- Learning system (defer to future if needed)\n- False positive tracking (YAGNI)\n- Sample weighting (70% recent, 30% old)\n- Fixed daily budget\n- Hardcoded thresholds\n\nZFC COMPLIANCE:\n- AI decides when to review (not hardcoded)\n- AI chooses review scope/depth\n- AI selects target areas based on activity\n- AI determines cost/benefit tradeoff\n- No brittle rules or static configuration","acceptance_criteria":"1.

The daemon auto-flushes DB to JSONL in the background, causing timing issues with VC's sync checks and making behavior unpredictable. VC should explicitly manage all database sync operations.\n\nPROBLEMS WITH DAEMON:\n- Auto-flush makes JSONL newer than DB at unpredictable times (causes vc-193)\n- Multiple daemon instances can run simultaneously (saw 7 instances during dogfooding)\n- Background sync hides when changes are actually persisted\n- Violates VC's principle of explicit, deterministic operations\n- Makes debugging harder (changes appear 'magically' in JSONL)\n\nVC SYNC MODEL:\nVC writes directly to the database during execution. The JSONL file should only be updated at explicit checkpoints (after successful execution, before git commits). This gives us:\n- Deterministic behavior (know exactly when JSONL is updated)\n- Atomic sync points (DB and JSONL updated together)\n- Clear audit trail (can see when sync happened in logs)\n- No race conditions between VC and daemon","design":"1.

Self-healing executor (can fix baseline failures) - NOT IMPLEMENTED (vc-208 bug blocks this)\n2. Phase 2: Baseline comparison (only NEW failures block) - NOT IMPLEMENTED\n3. Phase 3: Sandbox reuse - NOT IMPLEMENTED\n4. Auto-recovery workflows - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED\n5. Configuration tuning - BASIC ONLY\n6. Troubleshooting guides - DOCUMENTATION ONLY\n\nWhat VibeCoder NEEDS to be 'engineer in a box':\n1. Self-healing: Fix own baseline failures without human\n2. Self-troubleshooting: Diagnose and fix flaky tests, gate issues\n3. Self-tuning: Adjust cache TTL based on hit rate metrics\n4. Self-managing: Handle git issues, merge conflicts, stale branches\n5. Self-recovering: Auto-restart after crashes, resume interrupted work\n6. Self-monitoring: Track and fix performance degradation\n7. Self-improving: Learn from failures, adjust gates, improve prompts\n\nWhat needs to happen:\n1. Break PREFLIGHT.md into discrete issues in Beads\n2.

What didn't? Why?\n\n**Success criteria to continue**:\n- 3+ of 5 completed successfully (60%+ success rate)\n- Failures were caught by quality gates (not merged broken code)\n- Failure analysis shows fixable issues (not fundamental VC limitations)\n\n### Phase 2: Expansion (Weeks 2-3)\n6. **Double batch size**: 10 more bugs without no-auto-claim\n7. **Diversify complexity**: Include race conditions, shutdown logic, concurrency\n8. **Add monitoring**: Dashboard showing success rate by bug type\n9. **Refine gates**: Add any missing test coverage discovered\n\n**Success criteria to continue**:\n- 75%+ success rate across 15 bugs\n- \u003c20% human intervention rate\n- Lessons learned captured in issue tracker\n\n### Phase 3: New Default (Week 4+)\n10. **Make it policy**: no-auto-claim only for the 4 narrow criteria\n11. **Audit all open issues**: Remove inappropriate no-auto-claim labels\n12. **Document in CLAUDE.md**: Update agent instructions\n13. **Continue monitoring**: Ensure quality

for failed issues\n   - Preserve failure logs for analysis\n2. **Complexity estimation**: AI predicts success probability before claiming\n   - Track: file change count, test complexity, domain familiarity\n   - Use historical data: similar issues, success patterns\n3. **Enhanced monitoring**: Real-time dashboard\n   - Success rate by issue type (bug/feature), priority, complexity\n   - Intervention rate over time\n   - Quality gate pass rate trends\n\n### Short-term (L1 → L2, Weeks 3-6)\n4. **Recursive refinement**: Auto-create child issues (part of vc-2)\n   - When agent analysis discovers complexity, auto-decompose\n   - Create children with proper dependencies\n5. **Convergence detection**: Watchdog for infinite loops (vc-3)\n   - Track: repeated file edits, failed attempt count, time per issue\n   - Auto-abandon after N failed attempts, create blocking issue\n6. **Better progress visibility**:\n   - Real-time: \"currently editing file X\"\n   - Historical: time spent per phase (assessment, execution, gates)\n7. **Failure pattern detection**:\n   - Track common failure modes (timeout, test failures, build errors)\n   - Suggest preventive measures\n\n### Medium-term (L2 → L3, Months 2-3)\n8. **Self-code-review**: VC reviews its own PRs\n   - AI analyzes diff, creates follow-on issues for discovered problems\n   - Enforces code quality standards\n9. **Cross-issue learning**: Track patterns across issues\n   - \"Similar to vc-X which succeeded with approach Y\"\n   - \"Avoid pattern Z which failed 3 times\"\n10. **Approval gates**: Human review required for sensitive changes\n    - DB schema changes\n    - Security-critical code (auth, crypto)\n    - Public API changes\n\n### Long-term (L3 → L4, Months 4-6)\n11. **Strategic planner**: AI prioritizes backlog (part of vc-223)\n    - Considers: blocker relationships, priority, complexity, success probability\n    - Balances: quick wins vs. important work, bug fixing vs. features\n12. **Multi-worker coordination**: Run N agents concurrently\n    - Work allocation: smartly distribute issues\n    - Conflict resolution: detect overlapping file changes\n13. **Self-optimization**: Tune own parameters\n    - Quality gate timeout\n    - Complexity thresholds\n    - Retry strategies\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**Risk**: Infinite loops, repeatedly failing same issue\n- **Mitigation**: Convergence detection (vc-3), max retry limits\n- **Monitoring**: Alert on \u003e3 attempts for same issue\n\n**Risk**: Breaking the baseline, can't run tests\n- **Mitigation**: Self-healing (vc-210), auto-rollback\n- **Monitoring**: Baseline status in dashboard\n\n**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypass)\n- **Mitigation**: Security-focused gates, human approval for auth/crypto\n- **Monitoring**: Track security-related test coverage\n\n**Risk**: Performance regressions\n- **Mitigation**: Benchmark gates, load testing\n- **Monitoring**: Track test execution time trends\n\n### Process Risks\n\n**Risk**: Over-confidence, promoting to next level too soon\n- **Mitigation**: Hard metrics required for promotion (no feelings)\n- **Monitoring**: Success rate must meet criteria for 2+ weeks\n\n**Risk**: Under-confidence, keeping no-auto-claim too long\n- **Mitigation**: Force bounded experiments, measure actual outcomes\n- **Monitoring**: Track what would have happened if VC claimed the work\n\n**Risk**: Scope creep, trying to do too much per level\n- **Mitigation**: Each level has clear boundaries and success criteria\n- **Monitoring**: Review level definitions monthly\n\n**Risk**: Quality regression, backsliding on metrics\n- **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, automatic alerts\n- **Monitoring**: Week-over-week comparison, alert on \u003e10% quality drop\n\n### Human Risks\n\n**Risk**: Premature trust, not monitoring VC closely enough\n- **Mitigation**: Better observability, require dashboard review\n- **Monitoring**: Human checks dashboard 2x daily minimum\n\n**Risk**: Excessive caution, intervening too early\n- **Mitigation**: Define clear intervention criteria, let VC try\n- **Monitoring**: Track intervention reasons, ensure they're valid\n\n**Risk**: Monitoring fatigue, can't keep up with activity feed\n- **Mitigation**: Better dashboards, summarized reports\n-

on strategy\n\n---\n\n## The Ultimate Goal\n\n**In 6 months, you say**: \"VC, add CSV export feature\"\n\n**VC responds**:\n1. Creates epic vc-X: \"CSV Export Feature\"\n2. Breaks it down: vc-X-1 (data model), vc-X-2 (export logic), vc-X-3 (CLI), vc-X-4 (tests)\n3. Adds dependencies: vc-X-2 depends on vc-X-1, vc-X-3 depends on vc-X-2, etc.\n4. Starts claiming ready work autonomously\n5. Implements, tests, fixes issues it discovers\n6. Creates PRs for your review: \"CSV data model\", \"CSV export implementation\", etc.\n7. Discovers edge cases: \"What about Unicode?\", \"What about large files?\"\n8. Files follow-on issues: vc-X-5 (streaming for large files), vc-X-6 (Unicode handling)\n9. Continues until entire feature is production-ready\n\n**Your role**: Review PRs, make product decisions (should we support streaming?), provide vision\n**VC's role**: All implementation, testing, refinement, bug fixing, edge case discovery\n\n**That's when VC becomes the preferred tool** - because it's better at sustained, careful engineering work than rapid iteration in a 10-minute context window.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Will Work\n\n1. **Proven foundation**: Already 260 closed, 90.9% quality, 155 issues/week\n2. **Safety in place**: Gates, supervision, sandboxing, self-healing all working\n3. **Clear ladder**: Graduated autonomy, no giant leaps\n4. **Data-driven**: Metrics determine promotion, not feelings\n5. **Bounded experiments**: Test hypotheses with small batches first\n6. **Feedback loops**: Learn from failures, improve systematically\n7. **Right tool for job**: VC's strengths (sustained work, no context limit) match the goal\n\nThe key insight: **Stop treating VC like it's fragile**. It has safety nets. Let it try hard problems and learn. That's how it becomes capable.","acceptance_criteria":"# Phase 1: Policy Definition (This Week)\n- [x] Comprehensive self-hosting plan created with capability ladder (L0-L5)\n- [ ] New no-auto-claim policy documented: ONLY for external coordination, human creativity, business judgment, pure research\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with new policy\n- [ ] All open issues audited for inappropriate no-auto-claim labels\n- [ ] Initial experiment designed: 5 code review bugs selected\n\n# Phase 2: Controlled Experiment (Weeks 1-2)\n- [ ] Remove no-auto-claim from experiment candidates: vc-5783, vc-0d58, vc-28d9, vc-25e5, vc-ffbe\n- [ ] Monitor outcomes: track success rate, failure modes, intervention points\n- [ ] Basic monitoring dashboard built: success rate, intervention rate, quality gate pass rate\n- [ ] Results analyzed: document what worked, what didn't, why\n- [ ] Decision made: continue to expansion phase (60%+ success required)\n\n# Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 2-3)\n- [ ] Phase 2 experiment: 10 more bugs without no-auto-claim\n- [ ] Auto-rollback implemented: revert changes when quality gates fail\n- [ ] Complexity estimation: AI predicts success probability before claiming\n- [ ] Results tracked: 75%+ success rate across 15 bugs required to continue\n\n# Phase 4: New Default (Week 4+)\n- [ ] Make narrow policy the default: update all documentation\n- [ ] Audit complete: all inappropriate no-auto-claim labels removed\n- [ ] Monitoring enhanced: trends over time, failure pattern detection\n- [ ] L1 \"Bug Crusher\" metrics achieved:\n  - 50+ bugs completed (including \"delicate\" concurrency, shutdown, race conditions)\n  - 85%+ success rate on previously no-auto-claim bugs\n  - \u003c15% human intervention rate\n  - Zero catastrophic failures (broken main branch)\n\n# Phase 5: L2 Planning\n- [ ] Infrastructure roadmap for L2 \"Feature Builder\" defined\n- [ ] Recursive refinement (vc-2) prioritized\n- [ ] Convergence detection (vc-3) prioritized\n- [ ] L2 success criteria validated: ready to start next phase","notes":"Phase 1 audit complete: Policy documented, CLAUDE.md updated, all open issues audited (reduced from 4 to 2 no-auto-claim labels), Phase 1 experiment (vc-8d71) closed with 3/3 success.

This is recommended for DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) and migrations. VC currently uses UnderlyingDB() exclusively.

This is the recommended pattern for DDL operations (CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE) and migration scripts per beads/EXTENDING.md.\n\n- UnderlyingDB() - Returns connection pool, use for general queries\n- UnderlyingConn(ctx) - Returns single connection, MUST be explicitly closed\n  * Recommended for DDL operations, migrations, connection-level state\n  * Provides explicit lifetime boundaries\n  * Better transaction control\n\n# Current State in VC\n\n1. wrapper.go:43 - Caches *sql.DB from UnderlyingDB() for all operations\n2. wrapper.go:49 - Creates VC extension tables using cached DB\n3. migrations.go - Migration framework uses *sql.DB parameter\n4. sandbox/database.go:86 - Uses independent sql.Open() (already correct)\n\n# Proposed Changes\n\n## 1. Extension Tables (wrapper.go)\n\nUse UnderlyingConn(ctx) for DDL:\n- Get scoped connection for table creation\n- defer conn.Close() to ensure cleanup\n- Still cache UnderlyingDB() for regular queries\n\n## 2. Migration Framework (migrations.go)\n\nUpdate to accept Storage interface:\n- Manager.ApplySQLite(store Storage) gets UnderlyingConn(ctx)\n- applySQLiteMigration uses *sql.Conn instead of *sql.DB\n- Proper defer close on all code paths\n\n## 3. No Changes\n\n- Regular queries (agent events, mission state) keep using UnderlyingDB()\n- sandbox/database.go already uses independent connection\n\n# Benefits\n\n1. Follows beads best practices\n2.

No orphan detection or cleanup mechanism.\n\n**Breakdown by assignee:**\n- ai-supervisor: 43+ issues (executor worker orphans)\n- Others: ~164 issues (need to investigate)\n\n**Examples of orphaned issues:**\n- vc-07da, vc-2073, vc-3d8f, vc-4d95, vc-8fa9, vc-9b22, vc-db5d, vc-fc8f (from Phase 2 failure)\n- vc-0ed2, vc-738b, vc-d2d6, vc-4ee2 (quota/circular dependency issues)\n- Many discovered:blocker issues that may be stale\n\n**Location:** Database-wide issue, affects issue status management\n\n**Severity:** High - blocks visibility into real work state, prevents clean

The method signature doesn't enforce this invariant.\n\nFix: Either (a) add a separate unlocked version _checkCircuitBreakerLocked that assumes mutex is held, (b) use sync.RWMutex and document locking requirements clearly, or (c) refactor to use a separate lock for circuit breaker state.\n\n_This issue was automatically created by AI code quality analysis (vc-216)._","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","assignee":"ai-supervisor","created_at":"2025-11-02T14:52:06.612402-08:00","updated_at":"2025-11-02T14:52:06.612402-08:00"}

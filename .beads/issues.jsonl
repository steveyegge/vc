What are the ACTUAL criteria for no-auto-claim? (Not 'seems hard')\n2. Should we remove no-auto-claim from existing issues that VC could handle?\n3. How do we build confidence in VC tackling 'delicate' code?\n4. What safety nets do we need (better quality gates, rollback, monitoring)?\n5. Should vc-5783, vc-0d58, vc-28d9, etc. be auto-claimable?

75%+ success rate across 15 bugs\n- \u003c20% human intervention rate\n- Lessons learned captured in issue tracker\n\n### Phase 3: New Default (Week 4+)\n10. **Make it policy**: no-auto-claim only for the 4 narrow criteria\n11. **Audit all open issues**: Remove inappropriate no-auto-claim labels\n12. **Document in CLAUDE.md**: Update agent instructions\n13. **Continue monitoring**: Ensure quality doesn't regress\n\n**Success criteria for L1 \"Bug Crusher\"**:\n- 50+ bugs completed with new policy\n- 85%+ success rate on previously \"delicate\" bugs\n- \u003c15% human intervention rate\n\n---\n\n## Infrastructure Improvements Needed\n\n### Immediate (L0 → L1, Week 1-2)\n1. **Auto-rollback**: Revert changes when quality gates fail\n   - `git worktree remove` + `git reset --hard` for failed issues\n   - Preserve failure logs for analysis\n2. **Complexity estimation**: AI predicts success probability before claiming\n   - Track: file change count, test complexity, domain familiarity\n   - Use historical data: similar issues, success patterns\n3. **Enhanced monitoring**: Real-time dashboard\n   - Success rate by issue type (bug/feature), priority, complexity\n   - Intervention rate over time\n   - Quality gate pass rate trends\n\n### Short-term (L1 → L2, Weeks 3-6)\n4. **Recursive refinement**: Auto-create child issues (part of vc-2)\n   - When agent analysis discovers complexity, auto-decompose\n   - Create children with proper dependencies\n5. **Convergence detection**: Watchdog for infinite loops (vc-3)\n   - Track: repeated file edits, failed attempt count, time per issue\n   - Auto-abandon after N failed attempts, create blocking issue\n6. **Better progress visibility**:\n   - Real-time: \"currently editing file X\"\n   - Historical: time spent per phase (assessment, execution, gates)\n7. **Failure pattern detection**:\n   - Track common failure modes (timeout, test failures, build errors)\n   - Suggest preventive measures\n\n### Medium-term (L2 → L3, Months 2-3)\n8. **Self-code-review**: VC reviews its own PRs\n   - AI analyzes diff, creates follow-on issues for discovered problems\n   - Enforces code quality standards\n9. **Cross-issue learning**: Track patterns across issues\n   - \"Similar to vc-X which succeeded with approach Y\"\n   - \"Avoid pattern Z which failed 3 times\"\n10. **Approval gates**: Human review required for sensitive changes\n    - DB schema changes\n    - Security-critical code (auth, crypto)\n    - Public API changes\n\n### Long-term (L3 → L4, Months 4-6)\n11. **Strategic planner**: AI prioritizes backlog (part of vc-223)\n    - Considers: blocker relationships, priority, complexity, success probability\n    - Balances: quick wins vs. important work, bug fixing vs. features\n12. **Multi-worker coordination**: Run N agents concurrently\n    - Work allocation: smartly distribute issues\n    - Conflict resolution: detect overlapping file changes\n13. **Self-optimization**: Tune own parameters\n    - Quality gate timeout\n    - Complexity thresholds\n    - Retry strategies\n\n---\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n### Technical Risks\n\n**Risk**: Infinite loops, repeatedly failing same issue\n- **Mitigation**: Convergence detection (vc-3), max retry limits\n- **Monitoring**: Alert on \u003e3 attempts for same issue\n\n**Risk**: Breaking the baseline, can't run tests\n- **Mitigation**: Self-healing (vc-210), auto-rollback\n- **Monitoring**: Baseline status in dashboard\n\n**Risk**: Security vulnerabilities (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypass)\n- **Mitigation**: Security-focused gates, human approval for auth/crypto\n- **Monitoring**: Track security-related test coverage\n\n**Risk**: Performance regressions\n- **Mitigation**: Benchmark gates, load testing\n- **Monitoring**: Track test execution time trends\n\n### Process Risks\n\n**Risk**: Over-confidence, promoting to next level too soon\n- **Mitigation**: Hard metrics required for promotion (no feelings)\n- **Monitoring**: Success rate must meet criteria for 2+ weeks\n\n**Risk**: Under-confidence, keeping no-auto-claim too long\n- **Mitigation**: Force bounded experiments, measure actual outcomes\n- **Monitoring**: Track what would have happened if VC claimed the work\n\n**Risk**: Scope creep, trying to do too much per level\n- **Mitigation**: Each level has clear boundaries and success criteria\n- **Monitoring**: Review level definitions monthly\n\n**Risk**: Quality regression, backsliding on metrics\n- **Mitigation**: Continuous monitoring, automatic alerts\n- **Monitoring**: Week-over-week comparison, alert on \u003e10% quality drop\n\n### Human Risks\n\n**Risk**: Premature trust, not monitoring VC closely enough\n- **Mitigation**: Better observability, require dashboard review\n- **Monitoring**: Human checks dashboard 2x daily minimum\n\n**Risk**: Excessive caution, intervening too early\n- **Mitigation**: Define clear intervention criteria, let VC try\n- **Monitoring**: Track intervention reasons, ensure they're valid\n\n**Risk**: Monitoring fatigue, can't keep up with activity feed\n- **Mitigation**: Better dashboards, summarized reports\n- **Monitoring**: Daily summary email, weekly review\n\n**Risk**: Context loss, forgetting why decisions were made\n- **Mitigation**: Everything in issue tracker with rich context\n- **Monitoring**: Review issue quality, ensure adequate documentation\n\n---\n\n## Success Metrics (Detailed)\n\n### L1 \"Bug Crusher\" Target Metrics\n- **Completion**: 50+ bugs from code review without

issues\n23. **Strategic planner**: AI prioritizes backlog (vc-223)\n24. **Approval gates**: Human review for schema, security, API changes\n25. **Achieve L4 metrics**: 90% VC-developed, human focuses on strategy\n\n---\n\n## The Ultimate Goal\n\n**In 6 months, you say**: \"VC, add CSV export feature\"\n\n**VC responds**:\n1. Creates epic vc-X: \"CSV Export Feature\"\n2. Breaks it down: vc-X-1 (data model), vc-X-2 (export logic), vc-X-3 (CLI), vc-X-4 (tests)\n3. Adds dependencies: vc-X-2 depends on vc-X-1, vc-X-3 depends on vc-X-2, etc.\n4. Starts claiming ready work autonomously\n5. Implements, tests, fixes issues it discovers\n6. Creates PRs for your review: \"CSV data model\", \"CSV export implementation\", etc.\n7. Discovers edge cases: \"What about Unicode?\", \"What about large files?\"\n8. Files follow-on issues: vc-X-5 (streaming for large files), vc-X-6 (Unicode handling)\n9. Continues until entire feature is production-ready\n\n**Your role**: Review PRs, make product decisions (should we support streaming?), provide vision\n**VC's role**: All implementation, testing, refinement, bug fixing, edge case discovery\n\n**That's when VC becomes the preferred tool** - because it's better at sustained, careful engineering work than rapid iteration in a 10-minute context window.\n\n---\n\n## Why This Will Work\n\n1. **Proven foundation**: Already 260 closed, 90.9% quality, 155 issues/week\n2. **Safety in place**: Gates, supervision, sandboxing, self-healing all working\n3. **Clear ladder**: Graduated autonomy, no giant leaps\n4. **Data-driven**: Metrics determine promotion, not feelings\n5. **Bounded experiments**: Test hypotheses with small batches first\n6. **Feedback loops**: Learn from failures, improve systematically\n7. **Right tool for job**: VC's strengths (sustained work, no context limit) match the goal\n\nThe key insight: **Stop treating VC like it's fragile**. It has safety nets. Let it try hard problems and learn. That's how it becomes capable.","acceptance_criteria":"# Phase 1: Policy Definition (This Week)\n- [x] Comprehensive self-hosting plan created with capability ladder (L0-L5)\n- [ ] New no-auto-claim policy documented: ONLY for external coordination, human creativity, business judgment, pure research\n- [ ] CLAUDE.md updated with new policy\n- [ ] All open issues audited for inappropriate no-auto-claim labels\n- [ ] Initial experiment designed: 5 code review bugs selected\n\n# Phase 2: Controlled Experiment (Weeks 1-2)\n- [ ] Remove no-auto-claim from experiment candidates: vc-5783, vc-0d58, vc-28d9, vc-25e5, vc-ffbe\n- [ ] Monitor outcomes: track success rate, failure modes, intervention points\n- [ ] Basic monitoring dashboard built: success rate, intervention rate, quality gate pass rate\n- [ ] Results analyzed: document what worked, what didn't, why\n- [ ] Decision made: continue to expansion phase (60%+ success required)\n\n# Phase 3: Expansion (Weeks 2-3)\n- [ ] Phase 2 experiment: 10 more bugs without no-auto-claim\n- [ ] Auto-rollback implemented: revert changes when quality gates fail\n- [ ] Complexity estimation: AI predicts success probability before claiming\n- [ ] Results tracked: 75%+ success rate across 15 bugs required to continue\n\n# Phase 4: New Default (Week 4+)\n- [ ] Make narrow policy the default: update all documentation\n- [ ] Audit complete: all inappropriate no-auto-claim labels removed\n- [ ] Monitoring enhanced: trends over time, failure pattern detection\n- [ ] L1 \"Bug Crusher\" metrics achieved:\n  - 50+ bugs completed (including \"delicate\" concurrency, shutdown, race conditions)\n  - 85%+ success rate on previously no-auto-claim bugs\n  - \u003c15% human intervention rate\n  - Zero catastrophic failures (broken main branch)\n\n# Phase 5: L2 Planning\n- [ ] Infrastructure roadmap for L2 \"Feature Builder\" defined\n- [ ] Recursive refinement (vc-2) prioritized\n- [ ] Convergence detection (vc-3) prioritized\n- [ ] L2 success criteria validated: ready to start next phase","notes":"Phase 1 audit complete: Policy documented, CLAUDE.md updated, all open issues audited (reduced from 4 to 2 no-auto-claim labels), Phase 1 experiment (vc-8d71) closed with 3/3 success.

The diff shows a new issue (vc-173z) was also created without acceptance criteria (no 'acceptance_criteria' field present in the JSON).\n\nThe .beads/issues.jsonl format allows issues to be created without acceptance criteria, but the system should enforce this requirement.\n\nAdd tests in internal/storage/beads tests:\n- CreateIssue() should reject issues with empty acceptance_criteria for types that require it (task, bug)\n- CreateIssue() should validate acceptance_criteria is not just whitespace\n- UpdateIssue() should preserve existing acceptance_criteria\n- Test that issues imported from JSONL without acceptance_criteria are flagged\n\nLocation: The storage layer should enforce this constraint, likely in internal/storage/beads/methods.go or a validation layer.\n\nThis is P0 because the meta-issue (vc-9yhu) exists specifically because validation failed to catch missing acceptance criteria, and the problem has already occurred in production (vc-hpcl).\n\n_This issue was

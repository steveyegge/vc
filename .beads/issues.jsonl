This is documentation debt - it will go stale, contradict reality, and become useless. This is exactly why we invented Beads.\n\nULTRATHINK ANALYSIS:\n\nWhat PREFLIGHT.md describes:\n1. Self-healing executor (can fix baseline failures) - NOT IMPLEMENTED (vc-208 bug blocks this)\n2. Phase 2: Baseline comparison (only NEW failures block) - NOT IMPLEMENTED\n3. Phase 3: Sandbox reuse - NOT IMPLEMENTED\n4. Auto-recovery workflows - PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED\n5. Configuration tuning - BASIC ONLY\n6. Troubleshooting guides - DOCUMENTATION ONLY\n\nWhat VibeCoder NEEDS to be 'engineer in a box':\n1. Self-healing: Fix own baseline failures without human\n2. Self-troubleshooting: Diagnose and fix flaky tests, gate issues\n3. Self-tuning: Adjust cache TTL based on hit rate metrics\n4. Self-managing: Handle git issues, merge conflicts, stale branches\n5. Self-recovering: Auto-restart after crashes, resume interrupted work\n6. Self-monitoring: Track and fix performance degradation\n7. Self-improving: Learn from failures, adjust gates, improve prompts\n\nWhat needs to happen:\n1. Break PREFLIGHT.md into discrete issues in Beads\n2. Each feature becomes tracked work with acceptance criteria\n3. Delete or minimize PREFLIGHT.md (keep only high-level overview)\n4. Make features discoverable through 'bd show' not markdown files\n5. Ensure all design/acceptance in Beads, not docs\n\nOUTCOME: VibeCoder can handle EVERYTHING a coding agent can handle, with opinionated controls, AI supervision, and self-sufficiency.
